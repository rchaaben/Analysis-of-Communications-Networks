    Exercise to plot auto correlation depending on lags. Run simulation until 10000 (or 100) packets are served.
    For the different rho values, simulation is run and the blocking probability is auto correlated.

    Note, that for some seeds with rho=0.DES and N=100, the variance of the auto covariance is 0 and returns an error.
